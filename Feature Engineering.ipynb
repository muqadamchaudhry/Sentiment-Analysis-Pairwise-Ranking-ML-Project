    "The goal is to derive meaningful insights from customer reviews by extracting and quantifying various linguistic and contextual features.\n",
    "This section outlines the different attributes derived from review content. These features aim to encapsulate every critical perspective expressed in reviews, enabling a more precise and analytical evaluation. Quantifying these dimensions is essential for achieving higher accuracy in downstream tasks.\n",
    "Noun Emphasis (Rn):\n",
    "Nouns typically represent the key subjects in a sentence, making them highly valuable in determining the core message of a review. The presence and significance of nouns indicate the topical relevance of the feedback. To compute this, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging was used to isolate nouns, and their weighted importance was calculated as:\n",
    "<br>Score(Rn) = TFIDF(nouns) / TFIDF(all terms)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Orientation (Rp):\n",
    "This metric quantifies the emotional tone of the review on a scale from -1 (strongly negative) to +1 (strongly positive), identifying whether the review leans toward a positive or negative opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opinion Measure (Rs):\n",
    "Subjectivity scores range from 0 to 1, indicating the degree to which a review expresses opinions (subjective) versus stating facts (objective).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Bournvita tastes very good with milk\" ‚Üí Subjective\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Bournvita is brown in color\" ‚Üí Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexical Diversity (Rc):\n",
    "This reflects the linguistic richness and complexity of a review by assessing the proportion of unique words it contains relative to the total unique vocabulary of the entire review set.\n",
    "<br>Rc = Unique words in a review / Unique words in full corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "Review Length (Rw):\n",
    "Simply counts the number of words in a review. Longer reviews may provide more detail, while shorter ones could be concise yet insightful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Categorization (Rd):\n",
    "High-quality reviews often focus on product functionality, usage experience, and effectiveness. To detect such content, a domain-specific word bank was created to classify reviews into categories like product-focused, delivery-related, or customer service-based.\n",
    "<br>We applied fuzzy string matching using Levenshtein distance to manage typographical errors. For instance, if a review says ‚ÄúMy dilivery was on time,‚Äù it is still mapped to the keyword \"delivery\" due to spelling similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "VADER Sentiment Score (Rsc):\n",
    "To enhance sentiment detection accuracy, we employed VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning), which is tailored for analyzing informal text like social media posts. It detects emotional tone in slang, emojis (üòÇ), emoticons (:), :D), and even distinguishes emphasis via capitalization (e.g., \"I am SAD\" vs \"I am sad\").\n",
    "Scoring criteria:\n",
