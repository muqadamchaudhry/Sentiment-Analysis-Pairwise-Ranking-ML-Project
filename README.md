# Pairwise Ranking and Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

This project implements a machine learning pipeline for pairwise ranking and sentiment analysis of textual data. It is designed to process, analyze, and model datasets where the goal is to both determine sentiment (e.g., informative/non-informative) and compare pairs of items to establish relative rankings.

## Features

- **Data Pipeline:** Automated scripts for data loading, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- **Pairwise Ranking:** Methods for comparing pairs of items (such as reviews, sentences, or products) to determine which is more positive or relevant.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classification models to detect sentiment in text data.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Jupyter notebooks and scripts for training, validating, and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Support for Small Datasets:** Includes techniques like out-of-bag scoring for robust evaluation when data is limited.

## Directory Structure

- Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `datapipeline.py`: Core data processing and pipeline logic.
- Additional scripts and resources for end-to-end experimentation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).
3. Explore the notebooks to follow the workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Use Cases

- Academic research on ranking and sentiment analysis.
- Prototyping ML solutions for review or feedback analysis.
- Learning resource for pairwise ranking and sentiment modeling.
